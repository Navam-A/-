      "title": "Stop Using localStorage!",
      "author": "Julien Etienne",
      "content": "Problems with localStorage?\nlocalStorage came about around 2009 as a 5MB string based storage. Let‚Äôs cut to the chase with some bullet points since our attention spans are in disarray these days:\n\n&#x2022; A collection of Strings: It can only store strings. If you want to store or retrieve you have to serialize and deserialize. If you forget to you may be exposed to quirks that have been responsible for all sorts of broken websites. E.g. When you store ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse‚Äù there is also a potential `null`, `undefined` or ‚Äú‚Äù to look out for depending on your setup.\n\n&#x2022; No Structured Data: JavaScript has a thing called The structured clone algorithm. You really need to know this is a thing. Modern APIs and updated APIs such as postMessage, WebWorkers, IndexedDB, Caches API, BroadcastChannel, Channel Messaging API, MessagePort and the History API all use structured data. It solves the problem with serializing and deserializing JSON within an app. localStorage had not been updated with this feature and there are no discussions around it happening in the future.\n\n&#x2022; Common security compromises: To clarify, you should never store sensitive data in any persistent storage that wasn‚Äôt designed specifically for it. Developers still commonly store Session IDs, JWTs, credit card details and API keys in localStorage. It‚Äôs a very common security hack because it is as easy as window.localStorage\n\n&#x2022; Performance: Historically localStorage had it‚Äôs slow moments, though there has been some optimisations over time that brings it up to a resonable performance. Despite this, it‚Äôs still not desirable for concurrent applications with a need for frequent transactions. If you benchmark on let‚Äôs say the latest MacBook without throttling performance you will may not understand the cost implications on low powered devices.\n\n&#x2022; Size Limitation: localStorage has a 5MB cap which is subject to eviction. This is a very small amount for modern applications. It‚Äôs difficult to store encoded media with such a small amount. And it‚Äôs not set in stone, just like all persistent storage on the web localStorage can and will be evicted by the browser at some point. You are expected to manage that part of the data life-cycle, despite there being no reminder to.",

      "content": "A controversial move by Meta last year, when it switched to charging users in the Europe Union for an ad-free subscription for access Facebook and/or Instagram unless they agreed to be tracked and profiled so it could keep running its attention-mining microtargeting ad business, has triggered a set of complaints from consumer rights groups. The complaints are being brought under the bloc's data protection rules.  Currently, Meta charges regional users ‚Ç¨9.99/month on web (or ‚Ç¨12.99/month on mobile) to opt out of seeing any adverts per linked Facebook and Instagram account. The only other choice EU users have if they want to access Facebook and Instagram is to agree to its tracking ‚Äî meaning the offer is: Literally pay for privacy; or 'pay' for free access by losing your privacy.  Eight consumer rights groups from across the region are filing complaints with national data protection authorities against this ‚Äúconsent or pay‚Äù choice, the European consumer organization, BEUC ‚Äî which is a membership and coordinating body for the groups ‚Äî announced today.",

      "content": "The Supreme Court will decide if ex-President Donald Trump is immune from being prosecuted on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election.  The 6-3 conservative majority court decided on Wednesday to hear Mr Trump's claims that he should be shielded from criminal liability.  The ruling marks the first time the court has weighed in on such a case.  A US Court of Appeals panel has already rejected Mr Trump's argument that he enjoys presidential immunity.  Mr Trump had claimed in the landmark legal case that he was immune from all criminal charges for acts he said fell within his duties as president.  But the appeals court ruled unanimously against the 77-year-old, writing that: \"We cannot accept former President Trump's claim that a president has unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralise the most fundamental check on executive power - the recognition and implementation of election results.\"",

Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe‚Äôs theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe.\n\n    As these characters‚Äô stories overlap and deepen, it becomes clear how much the people who live on the margins of white, Christian America struggle and what they must do to survive. When the truth is finally revealed about what happened on Chicken Hill and the part the town‚Äôs white establishment played in it, McBride shows us that even in dark times, it is love and community‚Äîheaven and earth‚Äîthat sustain us.\n\n    Bringing his masterly storytelling skills and his deep faith in humanity to The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store, James McBride has written a novel as compassionate as Deacon King Kong and as inventive as The Good Lord Bird.",
